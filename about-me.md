# About Me

Hi, I'm Azalea, a high school senior from Cincinnati, Ohio, with a deep fascination for the cosmos. My passion for astrophysics has led me to projects related to cosmological physics and atomic astrophysics. I'm particularly drawn to black holes and time scales.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm a strong advocate and leader for STEM education and leadership. I believe in empowering others to explore the science and technology. This belief has driven me to found and lead the Ohio FIRST Youth Advisory Council, where I work to advocate for and represent students across the state. I also lead my FRC robotics team, 9097 MachBusters, where I fundraised over $40,000 and reached over 10,000,000 through outreach initatives. I am also a mentor for a local middle school robotics team, 32021 AV8Rs. Additionally, I serve as the Sycamore Academic Teams Captain, promoting a collaborative and competitive environment among my peers.

These leadership experiences have taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and perseverance â€“ skills I apply both in my research endeavors and in my personal life. Speaking of personal life, I enjoy figure skating. It's a great way to unwind and express myself creatively.  And, as a fun fact, I'm a vegetarian!  I'm eager to continue exploring the universe and contributing to the field of astrophysics.  I'm excited to see what the future holds and how I can make a positive impact on the world.
